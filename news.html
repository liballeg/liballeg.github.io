</header>
<h1 id="welcome-to-allegro">Welcome to Allegro!</h1>
<p>Allegro is a cross-platform library mainly aimed at video game and
multimedia programming. It handles common, low-level tasks such as
creating windows, accepting user input, loading data, drawing images,
playing sounds, etc. and generally abstracting away the underlying
platform. However, Allegro is <em>not</em> a game engine: you are free
to design and structure your program as you like.</p>
<p>Allegro 5 has the following additional features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supported on Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, iPhone and Android</li>
<li>User-friendly, intuitive C API usable from C++ and many other
languages</li>
<li>Hardware accelerated bitmap and graphical primitive drawing support
(via OpenGL or Direct3D)</li>
<li>Audio recording support</li>
<li>Font loading and drawing</li>
<li>Video playback</li>
<li>Abstractions over shaders and low-level polygon drawing</li>
<li>And <a
href="http://liballeg.org/a5docs/trunk/getting_started.html">more</a>!</li>

<h2 id="allegro-5.2.0-released">2016-04-01 - Allegro 5.2.0
released!</h2>
<p>After many years of development in the unstable branch, the next
stable version of Allegro is ready for release! This version brings most
of the features from the unstable branch, but now with a guarantee of
backwards source and ABI compatibility. Allegro 5.2 is source but
<em>not</em> binary compatible with 5.0.</p>
<p>Allegro 5.2 is developed a little differently than 5.0 and 5.1 were.
This version combines both unstable and stable APIs in one branch. The
unstable branch is no more! Unstable APIs may be changed between
versions, or even removed entirely. Because of this, to use them you
must opt into this instability by defining <code>ALLEGRO_UNSTABLE</code>
definition before including Allegroâ€™s headers.</p>
<p>Combining the two branches will result in more rapid bug fixes and
faster addition of new features.</p>
