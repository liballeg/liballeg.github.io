<h1 id="welcome-to-allegro">Welcome to Allegro!</h1>
<p>Allegro is a cross-platform library mainly aimed at video game and multimedia programming. It handles common, low-level tasks such as creating windows, accepting user input, loading data, drawing images, playing sounds, etc. and generally abstracting away the underlying platform. However, Allegro is <em>not</em> a game engine: you are free to design and structure your program as you like.</p>
<p>Allegro 5 has the following additional features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supported on Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, iPhone and Android<sup>†</sup></li>
<li>User-friendly, intuitive C API usable from C++ and many other languages</li>
<li>Hardware accelerated bitmap and graphical primitive drawing support (via OpenGL or Direct3D)</li>
<li>Audio recording<sup>†</sup> support</li>
<li>Font loading and drawing</li>
<li>Video playback<sup>†</sup></li>
<li>Abstractions over shaders<sup>†</sup> and low-level polygon drawing</li>
<li>And <a href="http://liballeg.org/a5docs/trunk/getting_started.html">more</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p><sup>†</sup> <em>5.1.x only</em></p>
