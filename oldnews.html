released!</h2>

<h2 id="allegro-4.4.0-released">2009-12-22 - Allegro 4.4.0
released!</h2>
<p>This is the first release of the 4.4 branch, which is backwards
compatible with the stable 4.2 branch, and the intended successor. The
main change is that the following addons are bundled in, so you do not
have to hunt them down and install them separately: [AllegroGL],
[loadpng], [JPGalleg], [logg]. We have also switched over to the [CMake]
build system, which we have been using for the unstable 4.9 branch. See
the full list of [changes][changes 4.4].</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Allegro 4.4.0 does <em>not</em> support DOS,
BeOS/Haiku or QNX. We welcome interested parties to restore support for
any of these platforms. For Haiku/QNX, it should be a simply matter of
updating the build system.</p>

released!</h2>
<p>This is an bug fix release for Allegro 4.2. Here is a list of the
principal changes since version 4.2.2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix fnstsw compile bug with newer binutils.</li>
<li>Trent Gamblin made a small change to the Windows mouse driver to add
support for touchscreens (at least 1 of them).</li>
<li>Peter De Wachter made the ALSA driver work for hardware which does
not support unsigned samples.</li>
<li>Matthew Leverton fixed a problem with filename encoding and the
SYSTEM_NONE driver. Added set_filename_encoding(),
get_filename_encoding().</li>
<li>Milan Mimica made the MinGW and MSVC makefiles add the suffix “_c”
onto non-asm builds, and clarified that user programs linking against
the non-asm libraries must also defined ALLEGRO_USE_C. Mixing calling
conventions causes segfaults when functions are inlined.</li>
<li>AJ added detection for SSSE3, SSE4.1 and SSE4.2</li>
<li>David A. Capello made key_shifts work properly on Windows for
Control, Alt, and Shift.</li>
<li>Clarified that set_config_file() does not search for the given
config file in other locations, as Allegro does with allegro.cfg at
initialization.</li>

<li>Fixed problems with newer versions of autoconf.</li>

2006 - Allegro 4.3.0 has been released</h2>
<p>Allegro 4.3.0 has finally been released. This is a WIP version, which
will probably not work as expected for many things when using as a 4.2
drop in, although the 4.3 branch will be developed together with a
compatibility layer, mapping the 4.2 API onto the new 4.3 API. This
release is only the first release of the 4.3 branch though, and many if
not most things are not implemented yet. Get this new version from the

<h2 id="th-of-july-2006---speedhack-coming-up">18th of July, 2006 -
SpeedHack coming up</h2>
<p>The historical Allegro competition, which has been running yearly
since 1999, will be held this year in the first weekend of August. Head
over to the SpeedHack site for more information and registration. The
SpeedHack is a competition initially started by Arron Shutt. In it you
can show off your Allegro skills by writing a complete game from scratch
on a single weekend, following a set of rules published at the start,
and using only Allegro with addons, along with your favorite graphics
and sound programs. It has seen well known people from the Allegro
community compete themselves in the past, like Shawn Hargreaves or
Matthew Leverton, and even spun off a sister competition called TINS to
fill the year-long gaps between SpeedHacks.</p>
<h2 id="nd-of-july-2006---svn-back-at-sourceforge">2nd of July, 2006 -
SVN back at SourceForge</h2>
<p>The sourcecode of Allegro is back at SourceForge. Many thanks to BAF
for hosting our SVN repository until now, after we were forced to move
away from SourceForge since it would not provide SVN services yet last
year. By now, SourceForge provides SVN services, so we transfered our
code back and hopefully everything will keep working smoothly.</p>

<h2 id="th-of-june-2004---allegropro-the-successor-to-allegro">11th of
June, 2004 - AllegroPro, the successor to Allegro?</h2>
<p>During the end of the year 2001, a decision was made to create a new
Allegro 5 version which would break completely source compatibility with
previous Allegro APIs. New ideas and suggestions started to flow in to
form what today is the future section. But after the initial excitement,
not much work was being done with the exception of two core prototypes
written by Robert Jr Ohannessian and Peter Wang. The development of
Allegro 5 entered a stall phase from which it has not yet recovered.</p>
<p>Some months ago, Korval announced on the Allegro.cc forums that he
would start a new Allegro version, with a different design. He has now
written the first implementation of the core system. Maybe this is what
the next Allegro version will look like then.</p>
