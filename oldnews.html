<h2 id="allegro-4.4.0-released">2009-12-22 - Allegro 4.4.0 released!</h2>
<p>This is the first release of the 4.4 branch, which is backwards compatible with the stable 4.2 branch, and the intended successor. The main change is that the following addons are bundled in, so you do not have to hunt them down and install them separately: [AllegroGL], [loadpng], [JPGalleg], [logg]. We have also switched over to the [CMake] build system, which we have been using for the unstable 4.9 branch. See the full list of [changes][changes 4.4].</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Allegro 4.4.0 does <em>not</em> support DOS, BeOS/Haiku or QNX. We welcome interested parties to restore support for any of these platforms. For Haiku/QNX, it should be a simply matter of updating the build system.</p>

<p>This is an bug fix release for Allegro 4.2. Here is a list of the principal changes since version 4.2.2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix fnstsw compile bug with newer binutils.</li>
<li>Trent Gamblin made a small change to the Windows mouse driver to add support for touchscreens (at least 1 of them).</li>
<li>Peter De Wachter made the ALSA driver work for hardware which does not support unsigned samples.</li>
<li>Matthew Leverton fixed a problem with filename encoding and the SYSTEM_NONE driver. Added set_filename_encoding(), get_filename_encoding().</li>
<li>Milan Mimica made the MinGW and MSVC makefiles add the suffix &quot;_c&quot; onto non-asm builds, and clarified that user programs linking against the non-asm libraries must also defined ALLEGRO_USE_C. Mixing calling conventions causes segfaults when functions are inlined.</li>

<p>Allegro 4.3.0 has finally been released.

This release is only the first release of the 4.3 branch though, and many if not most things are not implemented yet. Get this new version from the Download section.

<h2 id="th-of-july-2006---speedhack-coming-up">18th of July, 2006 - SpeedHack coming up</h2>
<p>The historical Allegro competition, which has been running yearly since 1999, will be held this year in the first weekend of August. Head over to the SpeedHack site for more information and registration. The SpeedHack is a competition initially started by Arron Shutt. In it you can show off your Allegro skills by writing a complete game from scratch on a single weekend, following a set of rules published at the start, and using only Allegro with addons, along with your favorite graphics and sound programs. It has seen well known people from the Allegro community compete themselves in the past, like Shawn Hargreaves or Matthew Leverton, and even spun off a sister competition called TINS to fill the year-long gaps between SpeedHacks.</p>
<h2 id="nd-of-july-2006---svn-back-at-sourceforge">2nd of July, 2006 - SVN back at SourceForge</h2>
<p>The sourcecode of Allegro is back at SourceForge. Many thanks to BAF for hosting our SVN repository until now, after we were forced to move away from SourceForge since it would not provide SVN services yet last year. By now, SourceForge provides SVN services, so we transfered our code back and hopefully everything will keep working smoothly.</p>

<h2 id="th-of-june-2004---allegropro-the-successor-to-allegro">11th of June, 2004 - AllegroPro, the successor to Allegro?</h2>
<p>During the end of the year 2001, a decision was made to create a new Allegro 5 version which would break completely source compatibility with previous Allegro APIs. New ideas and suggestions started to flow in to form what today is the future section. But after the initial excitement, not much work was being done with the exception of two core prototypes written by Robert Jr Ohannessian and Peter Wang. The development of Allegro 5 entered a stall phase from which it has not yet recovered.</p>
<p>Some months ago, Korval announced on the Allegro.cc forums that he would start a new Allegro version, with a different design. He has now written the first implementation of the core system. Maybe this is what the next Allegro version will look like then.</p>
